# Big-Data-Battle: Distributed Computation with MapReduce and Spark

This project was the fifth among the 5 amazing projects of the '95-702 - Distributed Systems for Information Systems Management' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). The course was taught by 3 eminent Professors of CMU - Prof. Mike McCarthy, Prof. Joe Mertz and Prof. Marty Barrett.

- Developed and implemented MapReduce programs for text analysis, including word and letter counting and identifying specific strings in large data sets.

- Analyzed extensive temperature data sets to create and run maximum and minimum temperature analysis programs.

- Examined tab-separated text files to investigate criminal cases in Pittsburgh and programmatically mapped the data on Google Earth.

- Built a Java Spark program to perform computations on input files, including counting the number of lines, words, distinct words, symbols, distinct symbols, and distinct letters
